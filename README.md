motivational tool that lessens the difficulty of tracking progress. This gamified approach not only
improves task prioritization but also fosters a sustainable commitment to a healthier lifestyle by making
fitness management both effective and enjoyable.

## Application of OOP Concepts

**ENCAPSULATION - Data Protection & Controlled Access**
- Making sensitive fields private (User.Password, User.Email, Pet.Experience)
- Providing public methods with validation for controlled access
- Hiding complex internal logic in private methods

**INHERITANCE - Code Reuse & Hierarchy**
- Creating Challenge as base class with common properties
- Having PremadeChallenge and CustomChallenge inherit shared functionality
- Using BaseEntity for common ID and timestamp properties

**POLYMORPHISM - Flexible Behaviors**
- Using abstract methods that children implement differently
- Creating interfaces for common behaviors across different classes
- Treating different objects uniformly through base class references

**ABSTRACTION - Hiding Complexity**
- Defining abstract classes with method contracts
- Hiding complex implementation details from users
- Providing simple interfaces for complex operations

**COHESION - Focused Responsibilities**
- Giving each class a single, clear responsibility
- Keeping methods focused on one specific task
- Separating concerns into different classes

**COUPLING - Minimal Dependencies**
- Depending on abstractions (interfaces) not concrete classes
- Using dependency injection in Blazor components
- Keeping classes independent and focused
