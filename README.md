# PawGress
Final Project for NCP 2103

### System Overview
  PawGress is an interactive exercise and wellness tracking system that helps users manage their
fitness journey through gamification. The application allows users to create, organize, and track custom
workout routines and wellness tasks while nurturing a virtual streak pet that evolves as users maintain
consistent exercise habits. By completing daily fitness challenges and maintaining workout streaks, users
can level up their companion pet, creating an engaging motivational system that encourages long-term
health commitment.

### System Purpose
  PawGress is designed for a universal audience, catering to anyone seeking to improve their fitness
consistency and organizational habits. While highly beneficial for students managing academic wellness
and professionals balancing work-life fitness, the application is equally valuable for casual users, fitness
enthusiasts, and individuals pursuing personal health goals. Its intuitive design ensures accessibility for
users of all technical backgrounds, making structured exercise management achievable for everyone.
